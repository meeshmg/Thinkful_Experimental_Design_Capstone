# Thinkful_Experimental_Design_Capstone
This repository contains information from my first capstone project with Thinkful. 
It is a research and experimental design project, focused around finding a data set and using statistical analysis to tell a compelling story about the data. 
The related presentation is also posted here as well. 

Political opinions and leanings of different Americans can be shaped by a multitude of different factors, both visible and psychological, of which many may seem intangible and immeasurable. 
Income and age are two of the most easily measured and concrete variables that could potentially inform an American’s political leanings and more subtle opinions. 

When it comes to generalizing political leanings, one of the most popular dinner party sayings is often attributed to Winston Churchill: 
“If you are not a liberal when you are young, you have no heart, and if you are not a conservative when you are old, you have no brain.” 
Similarly, income has been explored by multiple entities throughout the past few years (The Atlantic, Forbes, NPR, Pew Research Center) on how income affects political leanings.
