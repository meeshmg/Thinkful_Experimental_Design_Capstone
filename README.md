# Thinkful_Experimental_Design_Capstone
This repository contains information from my first capstone project with Thinkful. 
It is a research and experimental design project, focused around finding a data set and using statistical analysis to tell a compelling story about the data. 
The related presentation is also posted here as well. 

Abstract: 

Political opinions and leanings of different Americans can be shaped by a multitude of different factors, both visible and psychological, of which many may seem intangible and immeasurable. 
Income and age are two of the most easily measured and concrete variables that could potentially inform an American’s political leanings and more subtle opinions. 

When it comes to generalizing political leanings, one of the most popular dinner party sayings is often attributed to Winston Churchill: 
“If you are not a liberal when you are young, you have no heart, and if you are not a conservative when you are old, you have no brain.” 
Similarly, income has been explored by multiple entities throughout the past few years (The Atlantic, Forbes, NPR, Pew Research Center) on how income affects political leanings. 

THE DATA: 
This particular data set is just one month of data, from October 2017, of a survey series conducted monthly, called “The Pulse of the Nation”, by an entity called “Cards Against Humanity Saves America”. If this sounds familiar, it’s because “Cards Against Humanity” is the increasingly popular risque card game played by many Americans, which touches on subjects that many Americans think about but wouldn’t dare to address publicly. 

Their survey each month includes questions along the same vein. Even their own website, where much of the data is compiled and analyzed, calls to the unorthodox questions of social scientists and data analysts by saying: “Are you a social scientist or academic who studies public opinion? Want to ask Americans something that no funding agency or internal review board would approve in a million years? Maybe we can help!” This data is special because it asks unorthodox questions, in addition to more normal questions, such as “Have you ever eaten a kale salad?” and more, that could in time lead to interesting connections between political affiliations and cultural trends, which could help inform political activist groups how to connect these demographics in an authentic way that is deeper than just political affiliation, but instead by cultural trends and lifestyles. 

This survey series received funding for a year, brom September 2017 through August 2018, during a US presidential term that could be described as volatile at best. The dataset on the popular website “Kaggle”  can be found at the following link:

WHO MIGHT USE THIS DATA: 
This analysis of data should be used by political advocacy groups, their funding departments, campaign managers, and social media marketing managers and other relevant personnel. These entities can consider this analysis as a piece of data-informed evidence on how to conduct their campaigns, which demographics to target and how, and which issues to address and speak to, based on how this survey sample of Americans leans towards different opinions and political self-identifications based on their age and income.
